# Landing-Page-Project-with-Bootstrap

This is a project that I decided to do in my own time, building a landing page that uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and some SCSS.

This is the first webpage I built using Bootstrap.

Prior to building it, I was not very confident in using the Bootstrap framework,
so I made this webpage in order that I become more comfortable with the basics of Bootstrap 5, in particular the Bootstrap Grid,
as well as basic components such as buttons, cards and navbars.

I also designed the page to be responsive on devices of varying sizes (using Bootstrap).
